# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
'Medical Insurance Cost Prediction', involves developing a model to predict the cost of medical insurance based on a set of input features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region. The goal of this project is to help insurance companies and policyholders make better decisions regarding insurance policies and premiums.
To accomplish this, I needed to perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data is in a usable format for machine learning models. Performed some exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the input features and the target variable (charges).
